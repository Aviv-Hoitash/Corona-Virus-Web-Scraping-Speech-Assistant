# Corona-Virus-Web-Scraping-Speech-Assistant

This is a web scraper that scrapes data about corona virus from https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/.

Using the web scraper, there is a voice assistant that is always listening when ran. To use this you need a proper michrophone or else it
wont work.

Also to wake the program you have to say "hey Tosh". You can change this if you want to just remember the program wont do anything 
if you don't wake it.



Dependencies: playsound, speech_recognition, gtts, datetime, os, requests, bs4
